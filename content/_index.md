### Multilevel modeling II {#subtitle}

Welcome to the second course on multilevel modeling taught through the University of Oregon's College of Education. This course will be taught through [R](https://cran.r-project.org), a free and open-source statistical computing environment. We will dive deeper into the variance-covariance matrices of multilevel models, how predictions are made from multilevel models, and how to simulate data assuming a multilevel data structure. Both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to estimation will be covered. Please see the [schedule](../schedule) for a complete listing of topics.
