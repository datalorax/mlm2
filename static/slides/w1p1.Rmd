# whoisyou?

* Introduce yourself
* Why are you here?
* What pronouns would you like us to use for you for this class?
* What was one thing you did not related to academic work over winter break?
]

---

# A few class policies

--
* Be kind


--
* Be understanding and have patience, with others and yourself


--
* Help others whenever possible


--
Truly the most important part of this class. Important not just in terms of decency, but also in your learning, and most importantly, for equity. 

---
# A bit more specific

Normally I would have information here about welcoming kids into class.

Because we're virtual, that part is both easier and harder.


--

If you need to not attend class, or a portion of class, for any reason, that is fine.

--

Ideally you would let me know ahead of time. But we're in the middle of a pandemic and life is cray. Please .b[try] to contact me beforehand. If this isn't possible, please check in with me after.

---

# Last intro thing

* I'm here for you

* We won't have specific office hours, but know I'm always willing to meet

* This course, like all in the sequence, can be difficult. Don't suffer in silence. Don't do this alone.

# Materials
* Nearly everything will be distributed through the repo and through the website.

* Please clone the repo now, if you haven't already. Pull each week for the most recent changes.

* We'll use Canvas for grading, and that is essentially it.

---
# R Markdown notes
* These slides were produced with [**{xaringan}**](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan), an R Markdown variant. I encourage you to try it out and use it for your final project presentation.

* The website was also produced with R Markdown (sort of)
  + It's a [**{blogdown}**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) website with some custom CSS and Hugo shortcodes
  
* This course is not just about data viz, but also mediums for communication. This includes websites and [data dashboards](https://jenthompson.me/examples/insight_progress.html) among other possibilities.

class: inverse-red middle

# My assumptions about you

---
# I assume you

* Understand the R package ecosystem (how to find, install, load, and learn about them)


--
* Can read "flat" (i.e., rectangular) datasets into R 

  + I don't care what you use, but you should be using RStudio Projects & the [{here}](https://github.com/r-lib/here) package

    - See [Jenny Bryan's blog post](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/) for why.



---
* Can perform basic data wrangling and transformations in R, using the
tidyverse  

  + Leverage appropriate functions for introductory data science tasks (pipeline)
  + "clean up" the dataset using scripts and reproducible workflows

--

* Use version control with R via git and GitHub  


--
* Use R Markdown to create reproducible dynamic reports


---
# Learning objectives

* Transform data in a variety of ways to create effective data visualizations

--

* Understand and fluently apply different types of data joins

--
* Understand best practices in data visualization

--

* Customize ggplot2 graphics by reordering factors, creating themes, and applying ggthemes


--

* Create an online data visualization portfolio using distill and/or flexdashboards to demonstrate key learning 


---

# Labs

See the [assignments](https://dataviz-2021.netlify.app/assignments/) page of the website.

10 points each (30 points total; 15%)

1. Distributions & GitHub collabo 

1. Visual perception  & plot reproducing

1. Color


---
# Homework
20 points each (40 points; 20%)

* Basically the same as the labs, but scored correct/incorrect, and no in-class time devoted to them.

* Okay to work on collaboratively - I actively encourage you to do so as long as you're using a shared repo


--

* **Homework 1**: Creating new visuals while utilizing different types of joins 

* **Homework 2**: Visualizing uncertainty, tables, and plot refinement


---
# Quick note on reproducibility

A [great blog post](https://simplystatistics.org/2019/08/28/you-can-replicate-almost-any-plot-with-ggplot2/) by [Rafael Irizarry](https://twitter.com/rafalab) shows how almost any plot you see in popular media can be reproduced in R with ggplot.

--

### For example

# WSJ Version

# ggplot reproduction

# Data viz "in the wild" presentations
Everyone will present for ~5 minutes - order randomly assigned (coming up next)

* Find two data viz examples intended for two different audiences

* Discuss the following
  - What's trying to be communicated
  - How effective do you judge it? Why?
  - At least 1 area of strength
  - At least 1 area for (potential) improvement


---

# Proposal

### Four components:

* Description of the data source (**must** be publicly available)

* Preliminary ideas of different viz

* Identification of the intended audience for each viz 

* The intended message to be communicated for each viz 

---
# Draft

* Expected to still be a work in progress
  + Data visualizations should be largely complete

* Deployment not expected

* Provided to your peers so they can learn from you as much as you can learn from their feedback

---
# Peer Review
* We are all professionals here. It is imperative we act like it. 

* Understand the purpose of the exercise.  

* Zero tolerance policy for inappropriate comments

* Should be vigorously encouraging 

--

### Utilizing GitHub
You'll be assigned three proposals to review (5 points each)

* Fork their repo, embed comments & suggest changes to their code, submit a PR

---
# Presentation 
Order randomly assigned. Basically a chance to share what you created!

* Discuss what is trying to be communicated

* Share the final products

* Discuss the progression along the way and why specific changes were made
